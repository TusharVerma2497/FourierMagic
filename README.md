# FourierMagic
Description
This application demonstrates the use of fourier transform and fourier series by approximating any continous function that user draws on the drawing area into a fourier series using descrete fourier transform and then visually drawing the approximated series by denoting each term of sin/cos functions in the series with a circle of fixed radius and fixed angular velocity.
